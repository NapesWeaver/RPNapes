[Reverse Polish Notation Calcamatron](https://napesweaver.github.io/rpnapes/)

This has been an ongoing project since my earliest coding in JS. It works well, is rather spaghettified and contains a number of stubs (I still need to implement maths for imaginary numbers, for instance).
The code I lifted from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and similar sites is especially good ;)

This project does not use any JQuery and Works offline :)

## Calcamatron

This calcamatron makes use of a visible stack . Units are supported (no conversion as yet).

## Notes
A separate interface for note taking is implemented.

Stack and Notes can be saved independently, locally, to browser cookie. Saving and opening files, local to host device, is supported also.

## Tricorder

The tricorder doesn't do much. It displays the weather, from [forecast.io](https://forecast.io/) and [maps.darksky.net](https://maps.darksky.net) and has a few YouTube videos and Internet radio stations embedded in iFrames.

The original tricorder image is found on IMGBIN.

Special thanks to keiske84 :)
