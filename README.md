[Reverse Polish Notation Calcamatron](https://napesweaver.github.io/rpnapes/)

This has been an ongoing project since my earliest coding in JS. It works well, is rather spaghettified and contains a number of stubs (I still need to implement maths for imaginary numbers, for instance).
The code I lifted from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and similar sites is especially good ;)

This project does not use any JQuery and Works offline :)

## Calcamatron

This calcamatron makes use of a visible stack . Units are supported (no conversion as yet).

## Notes
A separate interface for note taking is implemented.

Stack and Notes can be saved independently, locally, to browser cookie. 
Saving and opening text files is supported also - with special thanks to Eli Grey for the use of [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/).

## Tricorder

The original tricorder image can be found on [IMGBIN](https://imgbin.com/png/7Ay8HnU3/medical-tricorder-star-trek-x-prize-foundation-hypospray-png). Special thanks to keiske84 :)

The tricorder doesn't do too much. It displays a weather forecast and weather map, from [darksky.net/forecast](https://darksky.net/forecast) and [maps.darksky.net](https://maps.darksky.net) And there are few YouTube videos and Internet radio stations embedded in iFrames.
